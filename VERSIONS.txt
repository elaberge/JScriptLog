JScriptLog 0.5.0.alpha
====================

¥ Fixed copy_term/2 and internal:copy_term/2.  Previously, the query: X=Y,copy_term(f(X,Y),f(a,Z)). would leave Z unbound (it should be bound Z=a).  Modified newDuplicateEnclosure to hash on the enclosure arrays, modified newDuplicateTermFromEnclosure to also keep a hash on the enclosure arrays to track the equivalent variables between terms, and modified replaceVariablesWithTerms slightly to change how the encls_hash value was stored.  

Thanks to Jeff Thompson for catching this bug! 

¥ Added the ->/2, ->/3, and if/3 predicates.  Also added internal:atom_setarg!/3 predicate for mutating an atom.

¥ Added meta-logical predicates: float/1 (same as number/1 because all numbers are float in Javascript), and integer/1.

¥ Added math operators: float/1, float_fractional_part/1, and float_integer_part/1 (same as integer/1).

¥ Added arg/3 predicate.

¥ Added term_variables/2 and ground/1 predicates.  Also added internal:term_variables/2 which both these predicates use, and added the enumFinalVariableEnclosures and enumVariables methods to find unbound variables in an enclosure and term.

¥ Added some generally useful internal predicates: internal:member/2, internal:append/3, internal:selectlist/4, internal:convlist/4, internal:inlist/2, internal:call/2.

¥ Added bagof/3.  Also added helper predicates: internal:bagof_results/3, internal:bagof_match/3.

¥ Added setof/3.  Also added helper predicates: internal:merge_sort/2, internal:singleton/2, internal:length/2, internal:merge_lists/2, internal:merge_all_pairs/2, internal:merge_pair/3.

¥ Added comparison operators: @</2, @=</2, @>/2, @>=/2.  Also added internal:compare/3, and comparison method jslog_compare in  JScriptLog_Unify.

¥ Removed jslog_identical.  Use jslog_compare instead.



JScriptLog 0.4.alpha
====================

¥ Modified the </2, =</2, >/2, and >=/2 operators to evaluate the LHS and RHS expressions before comparison.

¥ Added comparison operators: =:=/2 and =\=/2.

¥ Added math operators: ///2, mod/2, **/2, exp/1, log/1, sqrt/1, abs/1, sin/1, cos/1, tan/1, asin/1, acos/1, atan/1, atan2/2, integer/1, floor/1, ceiling/1, round/1, sign/1, /\/2, \//2, #/2, <</2, >>/2.

¥ Added repeat/0 and once/1 predicates.

¥ Added meta-logical predicates: var/1, nonvar/1, atom/1, atomic/1, compound/1, number/1.

¥ Modified tryGoal and retryGoal for the case where the goal represents a traversal (as determined at run-time) which needs to retry.  In the tryGoal function, the goal.retry_fn is set, so that on retry it is easy to determine if, and which, retry_fn to evaluate (this does not apply to TRAVERSE goals, which already have this information).

JScriptLog 0.3.alpha
====================

¥ Added retract/1 predicate and removeRuleFromRuleSet method. IMPORTANT NOTE: retract/1 only removes facts, not rules from the KB.  This will be fixed in the future when support for abolish/1 and clause/2 are introduced.

¥ Modified getTermNameArity to throw an error if term was not an atom (i.e., variables, numbers and objects don't have name/arity).

¥ Fixed protocol for calling FUNCTION and TRAVERSAL goal functions.  The KB is now set as a property of each goal at the start of the 'try'.

¥ Added isDynamicRuleSet method to test if a ruleset is dynamic.

¥ Added getRuleNameArityFromTerm method.

¥ Added JScriptLog_Hashtable.js file with objects and methods for a hashtable that supports objects as keys (not just strings).

¥ Fixed jslog_unify method so that equivalent variables are not bound (e.g.,previously, =(A,A), could cause infinite loop).

¥ Added asserta/1, assertz/1, and assert/1 predicates.  Added newDuplicateTermFromEnclosure and replaceVariablesWithTerms method.  Added internal:copy_term/2 predicate.

¥ Added a new term type for OBJECT reference (a term can reference an object).  Added newObjectReference and isObjectReference methods.  Updated jslog_toString to handle object reference case specially.

¥ Added newDuplicateTerm method to perform copy of a term.

¥ Added copy_term/2 predicate.  Added newDuplicateEnclosure method. 

¥ Added findall/3 predicate.  Added internal:findall/3 and a internal:atom_append!/2 atom mutator predicate.

¥ Added =../2 predicate.

¥ Added ==/2 and \==/2 identicallity test predicates.  Added jslog_identical method.

¥ Added \=/2 non-unifiable test predicate.


JScriptLog 0.2.alpha 
====================

¥ Added JScriptLog_Evaluate.js for expression evaluation.  is/2 now evaluates expressions of arbitrary complexity (only the basic math operations are supported at present: +,-,*,/). 

¥ Change references to PREDICATE to ATOM (e.g., TYPE_PREDICATE is now TYPE_ATOM, isPredicate is now isAtom, newPredicate is now newAtom, and TYPE_PREDICATE_GOAL is now TYPE_ATOM_GOAL).  Added specialized type for NUMBER.


JScriptLog 0.1.alpha 
====================

¥ Initial Release.
