JScriptLog 0.4.alpha
====================

¥ Modified tryGoal and retryGoal for the case where the goal represents a traversal (as determined at run-time) which needs to retry.  In the tryGoal function, the goal.retry_fn is set, so that on retry it is easy to determine if, and which, retry_fn to evaluate (this does not apply to TRAVERSE goals, which already have this information).

JScriptLog 0.3.alpha
====================

¥ Added retract/1 predicate and removeRuleFromRuleSet method. IMPORTANT NOTE: retract/1 only removes facts, not rules from the KB.  This will be fixed in the future when support for abolish/1 and clause/2 are introduced.

¥ Modified getTermNameArity to throw an error if term was not an atom (i.e., variables, numbers and objects don't have name/arity).

¥ Fixed protocol for calling FUNCTION and TRAVERSAL goal functions.  The KB is now set as a property of each goal at the start of the 'try'.

¥ Added isDynamicRuleSet method to test if a ruleset is dynamic.

¥ Added getRuleNameArityFromTerm method.

¥ Added JScriptLog_Hashtable.js file with objects and methods for a hashtable that supports objects as keys (not just strings).

¥ Fixed jslog_unify method so that equivalent variables are not bound (e.g.,previously, =(A,A), could cause infinite loop).

¥ Added asserta/1, assertz/1, and assert/1 predicates.  Added newDuplicateTermFromEnclosure and replaceVariablesWithTerms method.  Added internal:copy_term/2 predicate.

¥ Added a new term type for OBJECT reference (a term can reference an object).  Added newObjectReference and isObjectReference methods.  Updated jslog_toString to handle object reference case specially.

¥ Added newDuplicateTerm method to perform copy of a term.

¥ Added copy_term/2 predicate.  Added newDuplicateEnclosure method. 

¥ Added findall/3 predicate.  Added internal:findall/3 and a internal:atom_append!/2 atom mutator predicate.

¥ Added =../2 predicate.

¥ Added ==/2 and \==/2 identicallity test predicates.  Added jslog_identical method.

¥ Added \=/2 non-unifiable test predicate.


JScriptLog 0.2.alpha 
====================

¥ Added JScriptLog_Evaluate.js for expression evaluation.  is/2 now evaluates expressions of arbitrary complexity (only the basic math operations are supported at present: +,-,*,/). 

¥ Change references to PREDICATE to ATOM (e.g., TYPE_PREDICATE is now TYPE_ATOM, isPredicate is now isAtom, newPredicate is now newAtom, and TYPE_PREDICATE_GOAL is now TYPE_ATOM_GOAL).  Added specialized type for NUMBER.


JScriptLog 0.1.alpha 
====================

¥ Initial Release.
